FB has lots of good lawyers and lots of money so they may be able to thread the needle, but it\'s not certain.\n\nGenerally, if I had a client considering a similar move, I would have advised them to be very careful about this mark and perform significant due diligence since the space is so crowded already. Probably pick another name or prepare to drop some serious bucks on this (without a guarantee they\'ll win).\n\nI would expect FB is aware they are exposing themselves to potentially significant legal action, so they may be counting on this ending up being a money fight which they could win since they have astonishing amounts of money.\n\nBut consider, if FB cannot land the Meta mark with the USPTO, their rights in the mark (i.e., their ability to protect their mark with lawsuits) are significantly diminished.', '#DELETE FACEBOOK \n\n#DELETE META\n\n#DELETE ZUCKERBERG', 'Meta-mucil?', 'Sue for every dollar you can!
